    <p>
      Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base
      of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
      various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature,
      traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a
      pizzetta.
